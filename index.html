<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I received my B.S. in Engineering from <a href="https://https://meche.mit.edu//">MIT</a> in 2016 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2019.

  <br><br>I am an interdisciplinary scientist and engineer focusing on understanding and controlling cooperative agents. In my research, I explore how to algorithmically facilitate communication and adaptation for effective human-agent and agent-agent cooperation.
